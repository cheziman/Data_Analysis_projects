# This is a collection of my data Analysis projects

Each folder had a different project in it, where in the readme file you can:

1. Open a link to the notebook and see the project.
2. Open a link to a few favorite graphs and explanations about them (a subfolder of the project folder).
3. Keep on reading the readme file and get explanation and summary of the project and it's conclusions.


## Neat!! lets get started! :mage:
