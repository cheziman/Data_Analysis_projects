# A few graphs from the project
The full graphs and conclusions can be seen in the notebook.

### Hypotheses RICE / ICE score comparison
This graph is a comparison of RICE and ICE scores for different hypotheses (represented by numbers) 
- For an easy comparison, the RICE score is divided by 10 to match the scale of the ICE score (ICE = Impact * Confidence / Effort - MAX score of 100, and RICE = Reach * Impact * Confidence / Effort - MAX score of 1000)
