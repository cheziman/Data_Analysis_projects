## Description
This project is about running and analyzing the results of an A/A/B testing of a new font in the app of a startup company in the food product market.

## project goal :
Investigate user behavior for the company's app, and decide wether the experiment was successful


## Some of the methods used in this project are:
- Evaluating how solid the A/A/B test was done.
- Hypothesis testing.
- Event funnel anlysis.

## Favorite graph
This graph is an event funnel of how many users interacted with each of the event screens, split into the different test and control groups
- It shows the different group numbers in each screen are very similar.
- Almost 50% reached the `purchase complete` screen!
- It's both interesting and disturbing to find that there's a huge drop of users from the main screen to the other screens.

a short explanation and a couple more graphs can be seen in the [images folder](https://github.com/cheziman/My_Projects/tree/main/User_behaviour_AAB_test/images).
