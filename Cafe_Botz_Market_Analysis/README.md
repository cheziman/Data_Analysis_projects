# Analysis conclusions and recommendations:
Let us refer to our future cafe as **"Cafe Botz"**

- The majority (75%) of establishments type is a restaurant, but this resemnles a very large definition of many sub types like pizza, grill, etc. Fast food takes 11% of the types share, and cafe 4.5% slmost similar to the other types.<br>
    - **We should open Cafe Botz in a fast food type format.**
    
- 70% of the establishments do not belong to a chain. and 30% do belong to a chain, a chain of course will be more profitable for us as a company, but an individual business is easier to manage.
- There are slightly more chain businesses in the cafe and fast food type of restaurants (about 40%/60%).
    - **We should start Cafe Botz as an independent cafe, keeping in mind that when it is well established, we will create a chain of Cafe Botz, maybe even outside of LA!.**
- Only a few establishments have more than 60 seats, (and non has 50-60), But it seems that vast majority of establishments host up to 50 seats. The more seats the more space you need, and if most seats are occupied it's most profitable.
- Averagely, cafes have 29 seats, and fast food has 32.
    - **Cafe Botz should best aim to have no more than 30 seats. Even if all seats are constantly occupied we can expand when we are ready.**
- The three most business crowded streets are:
    - Willshire with 380 establishments.
    - West Sunset street with 367.
    - West Pico street with 342 establishments.
    - Any other street has below 269 establishments. (out of 50,000 streets in LA, only 243 streets have at least one restaurant.)
    - **Cafe Botz should be safe to open in either Willshire, west sunset, or west pico boulevards.***
